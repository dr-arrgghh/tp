### Project: StudMap

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Helped to coordinate multiple team meetings

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Proposed and implemented `StudentData` parameter object for easy extension of `Student` class so that features can be more easily implemented.
    * Features hinging on this infrastructure include attendance/participation/assignment tracking, and new fields added to `Student`, including Telegram Handle, GitHub username.
    * This infrastructure also eased the deletion of unneeded features, such as the `Address` field in `Student`.
  * Planned and wrote the abstraction of student editing via multiple abstract classes, including `IndexCommand`, `EditStudentCommand`, and `StudentEditor` in order to unify behaviour.
    * Features hinging on this infrastructure include the commands `edit`, `mark`, `unmark`, `grade`, `ungrade`, `participate`, `unparticipate`.
  * Abstracted the idea of commands that require parsing an `index` in `IndexCommand`, so that all index-related behaviour can be changed in one place.
    * This allowed the syntax of `all` to be used in all such commands, including those mentioned above.
    * This improved the extensibility of the code to possibly support more sophisticated syntax for specifying `index` in commands without major refactors.
  * Added the ability for some fields in `Student` such as `Email` and `Phone` to be left optional.
  * Added `MultiStateAttribute` to abstract the commonalities betweeen `Attendance`, `Assignment`, and `Participation`.

* **Documentation**:
  * Wrote User Guide and Developer Guide.

* **Community**:
  * Reviewed 36 pull requests from team members.
